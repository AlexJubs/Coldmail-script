# Coldmail-script

A python script for sending cold emails to recruiters - automate everything with python :D

This script is configured to send from a gmail account

`recruiter_emails.py` and `parse_mails.py` act as parsing agents to convert data from an excel sheet into a python dict - we loop through every column in the excel sheet and create an element in an array for them.
